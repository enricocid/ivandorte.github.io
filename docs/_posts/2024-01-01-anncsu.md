In this blog post, we will explore the scraping workflow I've developed to collect, process and store the official Italian addresses from [ANNCSU](https://www.anncsu.gov.it) - **Archivio Nazionale dei Numeri Civici delle Strade Urbane**. 

The toolkit includes an Android smartphone :iphone:, Python 3.11 (via [Termux terminal](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)) and [Caffeine Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.simonesestito.ntiles&hl=it). The latter ensures that the device remains awake during the scraping process, preventing it from going into sleep mode. The full pipeline is shown below:

## Key Steps

### 1. JSESSIONID and CAPTCHA bypass (mandatory)

Before diving into the scraping pipeline, it is necessary to solve the **CAPTCHA** challenge and grab the **JSESSIONID** value to be used in the subsequent requests. Follow these steps:
- Capture the **JSESSIONID** value from the Application â–º Cookie tab of the browser's **DevTools** or from the Chrome/Edge WebDriver (if using Selenium or Playwright, which is preferred);
- Solve the **CAPTCHA** challenge manually, or automatically with Selenium or Playwright. In the latter case, resolve the audio challenge and send a **POST** request to the [**c.json API**](https://www.anncsu.gov.it/system/modules/it.gov.sogei.rest/elements/c.json) with the following payload:

    ```
    {
        code: "RESOLVED_CAPTCHA_TEXT"
    }
    ```

### 2. Obtaining Municipality Data

The second step is to retrieve the list of all Italian municipalities along with their cadastral codes (**codcom**). You can achieve this by sending a **POST** request to the [**get.json**](https://www.anncsu.gov.it/system/modules/it.gov.sogei.rest/elements/get.json) endpoint with the following payload:

```
{
    req: "comdenomparz",
    denom: "Magic Word"
}
```

The **Magic Word** (undisclosed) cleverly bypasses the autocomplete mechanism, allowing us to obtain all the data in a single POST request!

> **Note:** remember to include the **JSESSIONID** value in the request headers!

### 3. Accessing Street Directory of the municipality

To access street directory for a specific municipality, you need to send a single POST request to the **get.json** endpoint with the following input payload:

```
{
    req: "listodocodcom2",
    denom: "Magic Word",
    codcom: e.g. H501
}
```

> **Note:** remember to include the **JSESSIONID** value in the request headers!

### 4. Collecting House Addresses

For efficient collection of all the house addresses within the street directory, I recommend sending multiple **asynchronous** POST requests to the **get.json**[^5] endpoint with the following parameters:

```
{
    req: "listaccodocodcom2",
    denom: e.g. VIA ROMA,
    codcom: e.g. H501,
    accparz: "Magic Word"
}
```

> **Note:** remember to include the **JSESSIONID** value in the request headers!

### 5. Data cleaning

After retrieving all the house addresses for a specific municipality, perform the following cleaning steps:
- Remove the duplicates;
- Eliminate empty geometries;
- Exclude the points outside the Italian boundaries (Bounding Box);

Finally, write the obtained data into a `geoparquet` file in "append" mode with **ZSTD** compression enabled.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will be able to obtain the entire dataset (+26M data points!!!) of the Italian addresses into a compact `geoparquet` file (~180mb), ready for exploration and mapping.
